#  Game Catalogue
A simple iOS Game Catalogue that provides Games information based on RAWG.

This repository is my one of the class assignments (with a little bit modification) at Dicoding Academy online course platform at class: Learn The Fundamental of iOS Application ([Belajar Fundamental Aplikasi iOS](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/202)). I've enrolled in this class as a part of IDCamp 2020 scholarship programme by Indosat Ooredoo and Dicoding Indonesia.
